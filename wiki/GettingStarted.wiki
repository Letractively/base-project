#summary Getting started.

= Introduction =

This document will outline and describe the steps needed to get the base-project & base-project-demo up and running in debug/development mode.

== Prerequisites ==
  * Java 5 or higher
  * Eclipse http://www.eclipse.org
  * Subclipse http://subclipse.tigris.org/
  * MySQL http://www.mysql.com

== Installation Steps ==
  # Download MySQL and perform a typical installation
  # Download mysql-gui-tools
  # Using MySQL Administrator create a new catalog for the base-project
  # Using the Administrator, create a base-project user for mysql and give the user all available privileges (Schema Privileges tab under User Administration)
  # Download Eclipse (for Java) and run it, create a new workspace if desired
  # Install the subversion plugin for Eclipse
  # Checkout the base-project SVN project:
    # New->Project->SVN->Checkout Projects from SVN
    # Create a new repository location (http://base-project.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/)
    # Checkout base-project & base-project-demo (highlight both and hit finish)
  # After the checkout, Eclipse will initialize and compile the projects, there should be no errors in either of the projects
  # Edit base-project-demo/source/settings_override.properties
    # Enter the mysql base-project username/password you created
    # Enter the mysql jdbc connect string, default is jdbc:mysql://localhost/baseproject?autoReconnect=true focus on the baseproject part if you created a different schema
    # If you would like table or column prefixes to be added to all tables/columns that are created (for example, if you are reusing an existing database/catalog and want to be sure table names do not collide), then edit the tablePrefix or columnPrefix settings
  # Find demo.launch in base-project-demo
  # Right-click demo.launch and select Run As->demo
  # The application will create all of the database tables, and will update them if their pojos changes
  # Congratulations, the application is up and running, you can now create a new user or login as the administrator (admin/p@$$w0rd)
